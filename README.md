DATA SCIENCE BOOTCAMP

This repository contains the projects I completed during the Data Science Bootcamp organized by TurkStudentCo. The aim of this educational program was to enhance my skills in the field of data science and to apply what I learned. Throughout the training, I worked with various datasets, developed my analytical thinking skills, and had the opportunity to create different machine learning models.
